What is WiHack ?

A WiFi attacking toolkit developed and designed mainly for Linux (preferrably Kali or Ubuntu).
Some tools are required to run the app, such as aircrack-ng, reaver and macchanger which can be installed by running the "install_requirements.sh" shell script if you don't have them already.

Latest version of Python is required (3.9), otherwise the tool might not function properly. 
Python requirements can be installed by running "python -r requirements.txt" on your machine.

Finally, run the tool by typing "python main.py"

Enjoy and hack responsibly :D
