What is WiHack ?

A WiFi attacking toolkit developed and designed mainly for Linux (preferrably Kali or Ubuntu).
Some tools are required to run the app, such as aircrack-ng, reaver and macchanger which can be installed by running the "install_requirements.sh" shell script if you don't have them already.

Latest version of Python is required (3.9), otherwise the tool might not function properly. 
Python requirements can be installed by running "python -r requirements.txt" on your machine.

For Ubuntu: Check `ubuntu_requirements.txt` for a list of dependencies you may need to install.

Finally, run the tool by typing "python main.py". Make sure to not move the "main.py" outside its main directory when running, and don't mess with files the tool creates.

Enjoy and hack responsibly :D

Great thanks to owner of the following sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tSlbqVQ59kGn8hgmwcPTHUECQ3o9YhXR91A_p7Nnj5Y/edit?pli=1#gid=2048815923
Gave us some insight and recommendations to develop the tool's 'recommended attacks' feature.
We also recommend checking it out for more detailed researched/tried routers and vendors, and common vulnerabilities and attack patterns found in them.
